# Dog Breed Identification with Neural Networks

This project focuses on using artificial intelligence and neural networks to create a model capable of identifying dog breeds from images. The project leverages Google Colab and TensorFlow for model training and prediction.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a prediction model that can accurately classify dog breeds based on images. The dataset used for training consists of over 10,000 images and is sourced from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data).

## Files

- **Model and Code**: The project files and the trained model can be accessed from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Avqkdinlfa3bsqkiA1FzLcDdQ7Iyz73D).

## Instructions

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-breed-classification.git
cd dog-breed-classification
```

# Model Training

## Data Preprocessing
###

The images are loaded and preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to prepare them for training.

## Model Architecture
###

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is defined, consisting of:

* Convolutional layers
* Pooling layers
* Fully connected layers

## Training
###

The model is trained on the dataset using appropriate:

* Loss functions
* Optimizers

## Evaluation
###

The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and hyperparameters are adjusted as needed to optimize results.

## Results
###

The trained model achieves a high accuracy in classifying dog breeds. Detailed results, including accuracy and loss plots, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
